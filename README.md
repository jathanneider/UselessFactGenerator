Overview:
          Fetches a random useless fact from the API uselessfacts.jsph.pl
          Uses Gradle for dependency management and execution.
          Command-line (CLI) based application.

Tested on Mac, unsure of Windows compatibility but gradlew.bat file included that *should* work.

For Mac:
In Terminal, enter the project folder and use "./gradlew run" to run the program.

For Windows: 
In Command Line, enter the project folder and use "gradlew.bat run" or ".\gradlew.bat run" to run the program.


Program should display 1 random useless fact upon execution.

If you run into issues running the program double check that you have given proper permissions to files in the project folder.
